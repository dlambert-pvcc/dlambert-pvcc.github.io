<h1>Intro</h1>

<p>Nuclear power seems scary. If you've never heard much about it beyond what happened at Chernobyl and Fukushima, then yeah, it must sounds like one of the most dangerous options for energy generation available to us. It probably produces a lot of power, sure, but can that really be worth the cost of human life, both directly and from radiation leaks?</p>

<p>Fair question. But that same question must then apply to coal.</p>

<h1>Nuclear as a Fear</h1>

<p>Addressing nuclear first: in the first four months after the Chernobyl disaster, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 28 workers died from the effects of radiation, and another 106 got acute radiation sickness. At least 200,000 cleanup workers over the course of two years received doses of radiation potentially well beyond safe background levels. That's pretty bad. That's worth worrying about happening again.</p>

<p>As for nuclear accidents that have followed, there was the Three Mile Island partial meltdown, which is recorded as the worst nuclear power plant accident in U.S. history. It's often referenced as one of the major nuclear plant incidents for which we should be wary of nuclear. What happened in the aftermath? Nothing. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission reports there were no deaths, no accounts of radiation sickness, and despite widespread fears of such, no cases of adverse effects could be correlated with the accident. None. The aftermath did lead, however, to changes in how the USNRC regulates its licencees, raising safety standards anyway.</p>

<p>Coal, meanwhile, doesn't have any incidents that sound as scary as Chernobyl. But it does have more concretely dangerous numbers. Coal produces far more raw electricity and has far more workers in the industry than nuclear, so it makes sense that the coal industry has more fatalies, sure -- but when you compare fatalies to the amount of raw electricity generated, there's a helpful graph the U.K. nonprofit Global Change Data Lab produced that demonstrates just how much more dangerous (and bad for our lungs) coal is than nuclear, even accounting for the Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island accidents.</p>

<p>The safety of power plants of any kind must be treated deadly serious, and according to the standards of any power industry, they are. But the safety of nuclear in particular doesn't look nearly as scary after the numbers come out.</p>

<h1>Nuclear as a Future</h1>

<p>Nuclear power is advancing in multiple ways, though -- not just in safety protocols, but in technology. An article from the University of Minnesota suggests a design called molten salt reactors which would likely have prevented the Fukushima disaster, and may be implemented in future plants to further mitigate risk.
